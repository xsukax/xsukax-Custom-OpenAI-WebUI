## üéØ Project Overview

xsukax Custom OpenAI WebUI is a standalone web application that enables seamless interaction with OpenAI's API and compatible language model APIs. Built as a self-contained HTML file, it offers a complete chat interface with conversation management, markdown rendering, and advanced features like thinking process visualization‚Äîall while maintaining absolute privacy through client-side data storage.

The application is designed for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who require direct API access without relying on third-party platforms or cloud storage solutions.

## üîí Security and Privacy Benefits

This application prioritizes user security and data privacy through several architectural decisions:

- **Zero Server Dependencies**: All data processing occurs entirely within your browser, eliminating intermediary servers that could intercept or store your information
- **Local-Only Data Storage**: Conversations, settings, and API credentials are stored exclusively in your browser's localStorage, never transmitted to external servers
- **Direct API Communication**: Messages are sent directly from your browser to the configured API endpoint without proxying through third-party services
- **No Telemetry or Tracking**: The application contains no analytics, tracking scripts, or external dependencies that could compromise your privacy
- **Open Source Transparency**: The complete source code is available for audit, ensuring no hidden functionality or data collection mechanisms
- **Client-Side Encryption Ready**: Since all data remains local, you can implement additional browser-based encryption tools for enhanced security
- **Portable and Self-Contained**: Operates as a single HTML file, reducing attack surface and simplifying security audits

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

1. **Configure API Settings**
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Settings button in the top-right corner
   - Enter your API URL (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`)
   - Enter your API Key (obtain from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
   - Click "üîÑ Fetch Models" to retrieve available models from your API

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Failed to fetch models"**
- Verify your API URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Switch to "Manual Input" mode and enter the model name directly

**Issue: API errors during chat**
- Confirm your API key hasn't expired
- Verify the selected model is available with your API plan
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Issue: Messages not persisting**
- Ensure browser localStorage is enabled
- Check that you haven't reached storage quota limits
- Some browsers in private/incognito mode may not persist data

**Issue: Streaming not working**
- Verify your API supports streaming responses
- Some proxy configurations may interfere with SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- Check browser console for connection errors
